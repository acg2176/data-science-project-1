Hi, my name is Anna Montserrat Guerrero but you can call me Montsie for short. I am currently a grad student at Columbia University studying data science.
As an aspiring data scientist, this repo will be dedicated to all the independent data science projects I have and will have accomplished. 
My data science journey began in April 2019 of this year and I want to continue growing in knowledge of this field and working hard to achieve my goals!
